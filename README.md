# Supported RC Protocols
CRSF
SBUS
GHST
ELRS

# preparing
### precompiled binaries
Precompiled binaries can be downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/cruwaller/rc_receiver_to_usb_hid/releases) page.

Basic configuration is
* 4 analog channels (0...2047)
* 8 buttons

SBUS 6xFULL (analogs) and 8xFULL are available if needed.

### compiling
